# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system.

  Using **unsupervised machine learning** , we process cryptocurrency data to fit machine learning models, cluster it, reduce its dimensions, and reduce their principal components using PCA. At the end we casn visualize the model through graphs from the resulting clustering algorithm.
